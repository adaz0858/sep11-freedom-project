Tool: EarSketch

Project: Making the background music for Angela's game using EarSketch. After making my background music, I will learn ImpactJS and help Angela with creating some other parts of her game. (Where the characters catches stars and has to count the amount of stars they have so if they input the correct amount at the end, they win, but if they insert wrong amount then they lose. There would also be mobs so if the characters touches one then they lose all the stars and have to recount).

* I watched a [YouTube tutorial](https://youtu.be/IzTgY1SLqgo?si=89TvcnY47OiMtb9m) on how to use ``EarSketch using JavaScript and I learned a tip to create a variable for each beat so I won't have to manually change everything.
* I tried, on `EarSketch`, to set up a `var` for a soundtrack and played it using `fitMedia(sound, track, start, end)`. I used the piano sound track and named it piano1. I didn't know what "track", "start", and "end" meant so I gave it different numbers. I found out that track just means what row I want my cound to be on, start is the measure where my sound starts on, and end is the measure where my sound stops on. I first tried `fitMedia(piano1, 1, 1, 2)` but the music sounded short so I changed the ending measure to 3 and it sounded more complete. I tried to change the track number to 2 to see what would happen but nothing really happened other than the sound moved from row 1 to 2.
* While typing in `fitMedia()`, I saw many other codes, I wonder what those codes are for and if I would ever have to use those. If those aren't codes then I wonder if what those are, are they just the sound names?
