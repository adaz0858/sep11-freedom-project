 # SEP11 Freedom Project
by **Ada Zhang**

## Context
I am a student at [HSTAT](https://www.hstat.org/) in the [Software Engineering Program](https://hstatsep.github.io/). The "Freedom Project" for SEP11 is a year-long project all about making something using JavaScript along with a third-party JS tool.

For my project, I chose to independently study **EarSketch** and **kaboom** in order to help me make **Dodger**. Dodger is a game that's created using kaboom.js with background music and sounds made using earsketch. I mainly focused on the took EarSketch to create sounds for the game while Angela mainly focused on making the game itself. I also tried to help Angela with Kaboom by trying to figure out the codes Angela is stuck on.

## Implications
##### PROS
* Tests and improves reflexes
* Fun game to play when bored
* Nice music when you lose so you won't be too mad (hopefully)
* Sounds on collide to make the game less boring
* Simple objective
##### CONS
* Can be raging if you keep losing
* Must jump before moving or else you're more likely to touch the egg
* Speed of player and fallen eggs are too fast
* Can't score too high due to eggs stacking up and most you can do is double jump
* Player is not constrained so it can fall off the map
